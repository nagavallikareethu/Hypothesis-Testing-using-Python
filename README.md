# Hypothesis Testing Project

This project explores **Hypothesis Testing**—a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. The goal is to demonstrate the hypothesis testing process and its significance in data-driven decision-making.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
1. To understand and apply the concept of hypothesis testing.
2. To define null (H₀) and alternative (H₁) hypotheses.
3. To select the appropriate statistical test for analyzing data.
4. To interpret the results and make informed decisions based on p-values.

## Process Followed

The following steps were carried out during this project:

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Relevant data for hypothesis testing was gathered. This dataset includes information that allows us to compare groups or identify relationships.

2. **Formulation of Hypotheses**  
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Represents the default assumption (e.g., no effect, no difference).  
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Represents the claim we aim to test (e.g., a significant difference exists).

3. **Setting the Significance Level (α)**  
   - The significance level (typically 0.05) was chosen to determine the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.

4. **Selecting Statistical Tests**  
   - Depending on the data and objectives, appropriate tests were selected:  
      - **t-test** for comparing two means.  
      - **Chi-square test** for categorical data.  
      - **ANOVA** for comparing means across multiple groups.

5. **Performing the Test**  
   - The chosen statistical test was applied to the dataset, and test statistics such as t-statistics, F-statistics, or chi-square values were calculated.

6. **Interpreting the Results**  
   - The **p-value** was analyzed:
     - If `p-value < α`, the null hypothesis was rejected.
     - If `p-value ≥ α`, there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Key Insights and Findings

- Hypothesis testing provided a systematic framework for analyzing the dataset.
- The results allowed for clear conclusions about group differences or relationships within the data.
- Statistical tools ensured accuracy and reliability in the decision-making process.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of Hypothesis Testing in data science. By following a structured approach, we were able to:
- Identify patterns in the data.
- Use statistical evidence to support or refute claims.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project includes [brief description of the dataset, such as its source and key attributes].  
For example:
- Source: Kaggle or other open datasets.
- Attributes: Includes variables such as `Age`, `Gender`, `Income`, and `Purchasing Behavior`.

## Applications

- **Business Analytics:** Testing the effectiveness of marketing strategies.  
- **Healthcare:** Comparing treatment outcomes across patient groups.  
- **Social Science:** Studying the relationship between variables like education level and income.

## Future Work

- Extend the analysis to more complex datasets.
- Explore additional statistical methods such as regression analysis or machine learning.
